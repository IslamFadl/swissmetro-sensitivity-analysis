Sensitivity Analysis of Mobility Modes Using Cost and Time
=================================

This repository contains a self‑contained analysis to the sensitivity of mobility and transportation modes based on chages in duration and cost of transport mode.  The goal is to estimate a
discrete choice (multinomial logit) model using the provided Swissmetro
dataset and to perform a sensitivity analysis on how customers react to
changes in travel time and costs.  The goal is
to visualise how modal market shares change when the attributes of each
transport option are varied.

## Problem context

The analysis could help make transparent and 
fare structures for public transportion. A
logit‑model example is supplied alongside a dataset.  The first segment is to
run this model and use its estimated values to conduct a sensitivity
analysis on time and cost.  The first solution depends on the `biogeme` package, while the second solution re‑implements the logit estimation using SciPy.

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
|`sensitivity_analysis_chart.py`|(first solution) uses the `biogeme` package to estimate the logit model and perform a sensitivity analysis and generate one plot. Running this file produces `sensitivity_analysis_chart.png`.|
| `combined_sensitivity_analysis.py` | (second solution) Python script that loads the data, estimates the multinomial logit model without `biogeme` using `SciPy`, performs the sensitivity analysis, and generates the plots.  Running this file produces `combined_sensitivity_analysis.png`. |
| `swissmetro.dat` | Tab‑separated dataset used to estimate the model. |
| `sensitivity_analysis_chart.png` and `combined_sensitivity_analysis_chart.png` | Example output showing how market shares change when travel time and cost are varied for each mode.  This file is generated by running the script. |

## Running the analysis

1. **Install dependencies.**  The script requires standard Python
   libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`) and `scipy`, all of which
   should be available in most Python environments. The first solution method requires installing `biogeme` from pip usinf `pip install biogeme`. No external API calls
   are made.

2. **Run the script.**  From the repository root, execute:

   ```
   python sensitivity_analysis.py & python sensitivity_analysis_chart.py & python combined_sensitivity_analysis.py

3. **We've got the charts**

## Credits
The Python script used for the sensitivity analysis was adapted from an original example provided by Prof. Michel Bierlaire (EPFL), implemented in Biogeme.
